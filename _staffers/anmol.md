Hi, I'm a software engineer on the Play Store at Google. I work on Android front-end, making different UI experiences to display apps. In the past I have worked as a backend engineer and also have web front end experience.

I am passionate about education so please don't hesitate to reach out to me. In my free time, I like playing pickleball, doing improv, going on hikes and playing board games.
