Hi! I'm a software engineer at Google working on Wear OS in the San Francisco office. I currently work on a Software Development Kit for Android apps. In the past, I've worked on web applications both before and after joining Google.

My hobbies include movies, riding an electric unicycle, and traveling when I can.

Learning is one of my favorite things so I find it super rewarding when I can help others learn something new. I'm looking forward to meeting students this semester!
