Hi! I'm a Privacy Engineer on the Android Security and Privacy team. I come from a non-traditional tech background and have had a variety of jobs throughout my career, including teaching high school and cybersecurity to young adults. Prior to Google, I worked as a security consultant for six years, where my day-to-day involved finding security vulnerabilities in networks, web applications, and mobile applications.

I now work in the field of privacy, which is a bit different from security but equally interesting! Don't hesitate to ask if you have questions about privacy or security!

In my spare time, I love to surf and play guitar.
