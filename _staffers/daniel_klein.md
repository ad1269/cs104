I'm a software engineer in Google Research, and I have worked in Shopping, Cloud, and in SRE, as well doing a PM (product manager) rotation and a few weeks in a datacenter. I've worked at Google for nearly 14 years, and have been a computer geek for 55 years (so I have seen a lot). And I have been a teacher for over 45 years because I love learning and sharing what I have learned! So you can ask me anything, because I still remember what is like to not know yet (working at Google means I *always* have something new to learn.)

My hobbies are photography, cycling, singing and inventing.
