I am a software engineer at Google working on Catzilla, a chaos engineering tool that measure service reliability under adverse conditions. This semester, I am teaching this class full time. I graduated from Cornell with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. My hobbies include lock picking, chess, and figuring out how to have more luck in my life.
