Hi there! I'm Joyce and I'm a Developer Relations engineer (ask me about it!) on the ChromeOS team at Google. I did my undergrad and master's at UC Berkeley in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I'm very passionate about education and was a GIR TA last year too! My other hobbies include tennis, hiking, baking, and learning to play the cello. I'm excited to meet you all and get to know you this semester!
