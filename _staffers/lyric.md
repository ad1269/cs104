Hello! My name is Lyric Sampson, an honors computer science major from Maryland. Just a little bit about me; I enjoy playing sports, hanging out with my friends and going bowling. (If you ever want to go, Iâ€™m always down!) I also LOVE sour patch kids and listening to R&B. This will be my 3rd semester as a TA for this course and I look forward to meeting you.
