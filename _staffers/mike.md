I joined Google NYC in 2010 as a Site Reliability Engineer, then changed roles, teams and locations several times. Right now I'm a Software Engineer in the Geo organization, working remotely in New Mexico and building maps. I was a GIR at Hampton University in 2021 and have been a Teaching Assistant for other programs (CSSI in 2020, TechExchange in 2022). In my spare time I enjoy cycling, hiking, and building electronic contraptions.
