Hi! I’m Olasubomi, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I'm also the president of the AAMU Computer Science club. This semester, I’m excited to be your Teaching Assistant for CS 104! I’m here to help you navigate the course material, answer any questions, and provide guidance on assignments. Beyond the classroom, I love playing table tennis, diving into a good novel, cooking, and traveling. I’m excited to be a part of your learning journey this semester and look forward to getting to know you all better. Feel free to reach out anytime!
