Hi! I'm Olasubomi, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science, originally from Lagos, Nigeria. This semester, I'm excited to be your Teaching Assistant for CS 104! I've previously worked as an undergraduate research assistant and had an amazing experience as a game engineering intern at HBCU IN LA x Activision. These roles have deepened my passion for tech, and I can't wait to share that enthusiasm with you. Iâ€™m here to help you navigate the course material, answer any questions, and provide guidance on assignments. Beyond the classroom, I love playing table tennis, chess, and basketball, diving into a good novel, experimenting in the kitchen, and traveling to explore new places. I'm excited to be part of your learning journey this semester and look forward to getting to know you all better. Feel free to reach out anytime!
