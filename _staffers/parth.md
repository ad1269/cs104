Hello! My name is Parth and I’m a software engineer at Google working on the Google Vault team. I grew up in Pleasanton, CA and recently graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 with a degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. In my free time, I love playing board games, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends. I’m really excited to get to know you all this semester, and feel free to reach out to talk about anything!
