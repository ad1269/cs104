Hello! I'm Prosper Banda, a junior Computer Science student from Gweru, Zimbabwe. I've been fortunate enough to gain hands-on experience from two internships. My first deep dive was into the realm of Machine Learning and AI, where I focused on the safe deployment of AI in autonomous vehicles. During the summer of 2023, I joined Meta, working closely with the Facebook Ads team.
Outside of my technical experiences, I've embraced leadership opportunities that came my way. I was proud to serve as the Vice President of the International Student Association and took on the responsibility of being a TA for CS104 in the spring of 2023. Furthermore, I had the honor of being a part of the AAMU Royal Court.\
\
Hobbies: Working out, playing soccer, watching sports, playing volleyball\
Something unique: I like the idea of mentorship, and I am currently working on a project to foster mentorship amongst college students
