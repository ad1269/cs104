Hi everyone! I'm Da'Quandalon Daniel, a Junior Computer Science Major hailing from Gadsden, AL! This will be my 3rd semester being an TA for the course and I look forward to working with everyone! Outside of my academics, I travel a lot doing hackathon and business case competitions. I love traveling and trying new restaurants! If you ever see me around campus don't be scared to say Hi! As always, Go Bulldogs :).\
\
Hobbies - I enjoy fishing, watching movies, and playing video games in my free time.\
Something Unique about me - I'm a really big sneakerhead and enjoy collecting shoes!
