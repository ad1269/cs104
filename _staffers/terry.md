Bonjour mes amis. I am Ms. Terry Miller, a native of Huntsville, AL and a twice alum from Alabama A&M University in Computer Science. I have worked at the university since 2003 in various offices and enjoy working with students. I love action packed-thriller type movies with espionage, intelligence and trade secrets. In my spare time, I cook gourmet dishes and travel with friends and family. One of the things on my bucket list it to travel to all 7 continents in the world. I have a 29 year old son and a 3 year old granddaughter, who is the boss of our family.
